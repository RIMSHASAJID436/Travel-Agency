<img src="./img/pia_banner_abudhabi.png" width="1200px" alt="">
<p>If the airline deems that a passenger with a disability has not provided enough information with a request for accommodation, the airline will follow up with the passenger, or the person making the request on their behalf, in order to obtain the necessary information.
    Request for a wheelchair generally includes assistance with the wheelchair. Passengers that require alternate assistance (development disorders, cognitive decline, visual/hearing impairments) may specify the extent of assistance required. 
    Requests can be made to airline by passenger, their representative, an attendant or their travel agent.
    Wheelchair requests for all inbound and outbound flights are relayed to wheelchair service providers 24-36 hours in advance. 
    Wheelchair passengers are handed over to special assistance agents for necessary care after check-in. 
    Requests can be made upon booking, after ticket issuance and on flight day. Requests at check-in and the boarding gate are also communicated to wheelchair service agents.
    Requests reflect on tickets and noted on boarding passes as WCHR for wheelchair assistance only
    Wheelchair requests can also be emailed to: care@piac.aero, ytotopk@piac.aero or ytocrpk@piac.aero</p>

This discount will be available only through PIA counters/sales offices. Disability ID card should be presented at the time of purchase of ticket.     (Conditions apply)</p>
